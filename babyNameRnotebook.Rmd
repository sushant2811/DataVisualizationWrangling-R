michael
```
```{r}

```


```{r}
Mike %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))
```

```{r}

Apparently there were some women named Mike as well!

```{r}

```

```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter (name == 'Sushant' | name == 'Aditi')
```

```{r}

# c stands for concantenta
```
```{r}
# Even better way

friends <- c("Sarah", "Hudson", "Chuck", "Christian")

df %>% filter(name %in% friends) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = name))+
  geom_line()

```

```{r}
plot <- df %>% filter(name %in% friends) %>%

  geom_point() +
